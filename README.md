# Time Razor. A multi effect containing a dual delay, additional effects and a modulation engine to shape your sound.

The intent of having this c++ repo is to show my work to potential employer. Others can learn and perhaps reuse some of the dsp and logic in their own project. 
Graphic assets, pluginProcessor.h/.cpp and pluginEditor.h/.cpp are not included in this repo. 
This project is created using Juce frame work https://juce.com/ Please check license if you are using this.
