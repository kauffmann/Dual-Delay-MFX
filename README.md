# Time Razor. A multi effect containing a dual delay, additional effects and a modulation engine to shape your sound.

The intent of having this c++ repo is to show my work to potential employer. Others can learn and perhaps reuse some of the dsp and logic in their own project. 

You can clone and build project in your IDE. You'll need JUCE framework 7.0.5+, included projucer, on your computer. https://juce.com/
If you are using mac you need to modify .projucer adding relevant exporter, e.g. xcode.
