# Time Razor. A multi effect containing a dual delay, additional effects and a modulation engine to shape your sound.

The intent of having this c++ repo is to show my work to potential employer. Others can learn and perhaps reuse some of the dsp and logic in their own project. 
This is not the original repository used when cross-platform developed Time Razor, working on Mac and Windows  systems. 
Graphic assets, presets, pluginProcessor.h/.cpp and pluginEditor.h/.cpp are not included in this repo. 
This project is created using Juce frame work https://juce.com/ Please check license if you are using this. Please note that JUCE version 7.0.12 is used for this project.
JUCE version 8 will not work, due to major changes to e.g. fonts.
